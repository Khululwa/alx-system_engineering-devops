#MY REVISED POST-MORTEM , FOR  MY READERS😊😁:

Step 1: INCIDENT

Title: "When Our Website Decided to Take a 4-Hour Coffee Break"

Step 2: Duration

The website enjoyed an unplanned siesta from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM (WAT) on October 9th, 2021.

Impact

Imagine a party where 90% of the guests were locked out – that's what happened to our users. The website was MIA, causing chaos.

Root Cause

So, why the no-show? Turns out, our trusty database server threw a hissy fit.

**Step 3: Timeline Events**

[2:00 PM (WAT)] - Monitoring alerts spike 🔴

2:00 PM (WAT): "SOS!" Monitoring alerts went bonkers with a spike in errors.

2:15 PM (WAT): Our fearless engineers sprang into action, like superheroes in capes.

2:30 PM (WAT): The hunt for the villain began – initially, we thought it was the network, but alas, it wasn't.

3:00 PM (WAT): We pointed fingers at the database. Blame game in progress.

4:00 PM (WAT): Verdict – database server in a coma.

4:30 PM (WAT): Distress signal sent to the database maintenance team. They brought their defibrillator.

6:00 PM (WAT): Crisis averted! Database server CPR worked, and the website was back on its feet.

Step 4: Root Cause and Resolution

So, what happened? Our trusty database server had a wardrobe malfunction. The storage subsystem failed, leading to data corruption. It needed a makeover.

Resolution

Our database maintenance team worked their magic – replaced the faulty parts, did a bit of data rehab, and restarted the server. Website: Back in action!

Step 5: Corrective and Preventative Measures

Detective Database: We're getting Sherlock Holmes-level monitoring to catch hardware failures early.

Backup Buddy: Implement a sidekick – a redundant database server for emergencies.

Backup Auditions: We're hosting regular backup auditions to ensure reliability.

Emergency Manual: Documented the incident response process for a faster rescue mission.

What We Learned

Moral of the story: Even tech needs a coffee break sometimes. But we're better prepared now to handle its caffeine cravings. 😄

User Impact

During the downtime, users turned into amateur detectives trying to figure out what went wrong. Some even started chanting "Server! Server!" like it was a sports game.


Quote of the Day

As one of our team members, Don, put it: "I've seen coffee breaks, but this was one for the IT history books!"

We're all back on track now, and our website is up and running, thanks to our superhero tech team!
